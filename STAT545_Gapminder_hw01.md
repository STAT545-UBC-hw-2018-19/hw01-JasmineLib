Goal: Compare average fluorescence intensity of two Mutant reporter proteins to that of Wildtype reporter

``` r
##Create three vectors containing values of fluorescence intensity values from independent experiments for both mutants and the wildtype 
fluor_m1 = c(55.74, 70.81, 36.74, 65.1, 57.22, 77.69, 53.58, 63.94, 50.8, 64.05, 45.09, 58.86)
fluor_m2 = c(43.37, 35.23, 67.87, 53.3, 63.4, 56.01, 66.81, 58.51, 67.98, 53.34, 66.42, 45.71)
fluor_wt = c(12.23, 10.72, 17.28, 16.55, 22.25, 15.81, 17.32, 12.8, 16.5, 14.71, 19.71, 17.86)
