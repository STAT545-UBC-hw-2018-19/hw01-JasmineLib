## About Me!
I'm a second year MSc Student in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](https://biochem.ubc.ca/). Briefly, we study translation and use RNA viruses as a model to study unique translation mechanisms. I'm excited to be taking this class, so I can do better analyses of my data, as well as start learning skills for future jobs! 

### Fun Facts
