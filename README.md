# Jasmine's Homework01 Assignment
This Repo is where I will be submitting exercises for the first [STAT 545A](http://stat545.com/) homework assignment :bowtie:

Note: I initially misunderstood homework assignment, so there are two sets of files in this Repo. 
The correct files are: 
[STAT545_Gapminder_Updated.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT545_Gapminder_Updated.Rmd)
and 
[STAT545_Gapminder_updated.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT545_Gapminder_Updated.md)

## About Me!
I'm a second year MSc Student in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](https://biochem.ubc.ca/). Briefly, we study translation and use RNA viruses as a model to study unique translation mechanisms. I'm excited to be taking this class, so I can do better analyses of my data, as well as start learning skills for future jobs! 

### Fun Facts
* Hiking and camping are my favourite activities, which is why I couldn't stay away from the West Coast. :tent: :evergreen_tree:
* My guilty pleasures are the dark chocolate almonds at Grocery Checkout in the Nest. :chocolate_bar:
